From June 2024 to April 2025, I worked as a Student Coordinator at AI4ALL, where I administered classes and aided students in Project Management, coding assistance, and refining their AI Models. 
I have completed 2 AI coding projects through courses offered by AI4All, many Codepath courses (Intro to Web Dev, Intermediate Technical Interview Prep, Internship Connection Program) and an INIT BUILD Web Dev 2 Project (check out the finished website here : https://init-dashboard.vercel.app/).
